/**
 * Sync all the Google API Calendars for the current day.
 * It's only used when the account is created.
 *
 * One could say "it's a bit a dup of sync_refresh" which is correct.
 * But in daily usage we should have few events to sync (most of time none)
 * so it doesn't hurt to run refresh sequentially, get the few events, get doc
 * titles, ...
 * But when the account is created we've to deal with potentially a large amount
 * of data and since everything here is almost running sequentially it can take
 * a while. So we just get all the different calendars in an async way.
 *
 * TODO: we're still getting the document titles sequentially and it introduces
 * some slowness so we should find out a way to deal with that stuff:
 *  - make an aysnc removal of all the titles;
 *  - add a task to get titles in a second shot in prioritizing events which are
 *    in the view.
 * Likely, the second one is a way more interesting and could be useful to update
 * titles in general.
 *
 * Because this task will be followed by a sync_refresh task whose sync range
 * will entirely encompass our single-day sync range here and the sync logic
 * knows how to gracefully handle being told about events it already knows about,
 * sync state correctness is largely maintained. The one potential situation
 * that could arise is if a calendar event is deleted between when this task
 * runs and when sync_refresh runs. In that case, the user will have a stale
 * calendar entry.
 * This can likely be addressed in the future when making sync_refresh and
 * GapiCalFolderSyncStateHelper handle changes in the sync window. In that case,
 * this task can instead be replaced by having sync_refresh operate with a
 * single-day sync range which then gets upgraded to have a larger sync range.
