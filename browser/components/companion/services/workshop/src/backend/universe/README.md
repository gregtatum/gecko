The MailUniverse is the root object of our mail backend and in charge of
coordinating a lot of fundamental things.  It lives at `../mailuniverse.js`.

Things in this directory are helpers related to that fundamental coordination
that we are able to factor into nice smaller pieces.

Other interesting directories for code that theoretically could go under this
subdirectory:
- ../task_infra: Task-related stuff
