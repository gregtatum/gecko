# ONNX Runtime vendoring help 


## ONNX Summary
[ONNX Runtime](https://onnxruntime.ai/) is a cross-platform inference and training machine-learning accelerator.

The main repository can be found [here.](https://github.com/microsoft/onnxruntime).

Our implementation is based on [this sample.](https://github.com/microsoft/onnxruntime-inference-examples/tree/main/js/quick-start_onnxruntime-web-script-tag)

## Upgrading
The included source can be updated by running the above sample and serializing the downloaded .js and .wasm source files.
(For instance by observing the files dowloaded via DevTools or with the Performance profiler.)
