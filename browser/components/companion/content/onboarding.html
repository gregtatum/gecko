  <h4>Page Action Menu</h4>
  <p>You can now use the Page Action Menu to close history items, mute videos, pin views, and more. You can also edit view titles in order to easily recognize and differentiate between similar pages.

  <h4>Sessions</h4>
  <p>To help you move from one activity to another, you have the ability to set aside your current session, and begin a fresh new session. This lets you set your views aside, and pick them back up in the Browse section of the Companion when you want to return to your previous activity.
